# HarmonicBondJaxForce

## 1. Theory

The chemical bond is represented by a harmonic potential:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}k(b-b_0)^2 $$

where $k$ is the force constant, $b$ is the distance betweeen two particles that forming a bond and $b_0$ is the equilibrium bond length. Note that in some other MD softwares, the potential form adopts a slight different form: $E=k(b-b_0)^2$. Users should check which form to use and multiply (or divide) the force constant by 2.

## 2. Frontend

The way to specify a harmonic bond in DMFF is the same as the way doing it in OpenMM:

```xml
<HarmonicBondForce>
 <Bond class1="C" class2="C" length="0.1525" k="259408.0" mask="true"/>
 <Bond class1="C" class2="CA" length="0.1409" k="392459.2" mask="true"/>
 <Bond class1="C" class2="CB" length="0.1419" k="374049.6" mask="true"/>
 ...
</HarmonicBondForce>
```

Every `<Bond>` tag defines a rule for creating harmonic bond interactions between atoms. Each tag may identify the atoms either by type (using the attributes `type1` and `type2`) or by class (using the attributes `class1` and `class2`). `length` is the equilibrium bond length in $\mathrm{nm}$, and `k` is the force constant in $\mathrm{kJ/mol/nm^2}$. 

When the tag has an attribute named `mask` and it's value set to `true`, this means the parameter is not trainable. Such information will be passed to `ParamSet.mask` (the corresponding mask value will be 0.0 if not trainable).


# HarmonicAngleJaxForce

## 1. Theory

The angle is represented by a harmonic potential:

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}k(\theta - \theta_0)^2 $$

where $k$ is the force constant, $\theta$ is the angle between three particles and $\theta_0$ is the equilibrium angle value. Similiar to `HarmonicBondJaxForce`, the parameters in some other MD softwares are defined to follow the potential form: $E=k(\theta-\theta_0)^2$. Be aware to adjust the parameters properly when applying the DMFF parameters to other softwares.

## 2. Frontend

The way to specify a harmonic angle in DMFF is the same as the way doing it in OpenMM:

```xml
<HarmonicAngleForce>
 <Angle class1="C" class2="C" class3="O" angle="2.094" k="669.44"/>
 <Angle class1="C" class2="C" class3="OH" angle="2.094" k="669.44"/>
 <Angle class1="CA" class2="C" class3="CA" angle="2.094" k="527.184" mask="true"/>
 ...
</HarmonicAngleForce>
```
Every `<Angle>` tag defines a rule for creating harmonic angle interactions between triplets of atoms. Each tag may identify the atoms either by type (using the attributes `type1`, `type2`, `type3`) or by class (using the attributes `class1`, `class2`, `class3`). The force field identifies every set of three atoms in the system where the first is bonded to the second, and the second to the third. `angle` is the equilibrium angle in radians, and `k` is the spring constant in $\mathrm{kJ/mol/radian^2}$.

When the tag has an attribute named `mask` and it's value set to `true`, this means the parameter is not trainable. Such information will be passed to `ParamSet.mask` (the corresponding mask value will be 0.0 if not trainable).

# PeriodicTorsionJaxForce

## 1. Theory

The torsion is represented by a truncated periodic Fourier series:

$$ E = \sum_{n=0}^{6} k_n(1 + \cos(n\phi-\phi_{0n})) $$

where $\phi$ is the dihedral angle formed by four particles, $n$ is the periodicity, $\phi_{0n}$ is the phase offset $k_{n}$ is the force constant. To perserve the symmetry, $\phi_{0n}$ usually adopts a value of $0$ (for $n=1,3,5$) or $\pi$ ($n=2,4,6$), and it is recommened to follow these definitions and not to optimize them in force field development.

## 2. Frontend

The way to specify a periodic torsion in DMFF is the same as the way doing it in OpenMM:

```xml
<PeriodicTorsionForce>
 <Proper class1="HC" class2="CT" class3="CT" class4="CT" periodicity1="3" phase1="0.0" k1="0.66944"/>
 <Proper class1="HC" class2="CT" class3="CT" class4="HC" periodicity1="3" phase1="0.0" k1="0.6276"/>
 ...
 <Improper class1="N" class2="C" class3="CT" class4="O" periodicity1="2" phase1="3.14159265359" k1="4.6024" mask="true"/>
 <Improper class1="N" class2="C" class3="CT" class4="H" periodicity1="2" phase1="3.14159265359" k1="4.6024" mask="true"/>
 ...
</PeriodicTorsionForce>
```
Every child tag defines a rule for creating periodic torsion interactions between sets of four atoms. Each tag may identify the atoms either by type (using the attributes `type1`, `type2`, ...) or by class (using the attributes `class1`, `class2`, ...).

The force field recognizes two different types of torsions: `Proper` and `Improper`. A proper torsion involves four atoms that are bonded in sequence: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4. An improper torsion involves a central atom and three others that are bonded to it: atoms 2, 3, and 4 are all bonded to atom 1.  `periodicity1` is the periodicity of the torsion, `phase1` is the phase offset in radians, and `k1` is the force constant in kJ/mol. To add a second periodicity, just add three more attributes: `periodicity2`, `phase2`, and `k2`. **The maxium periodicity supported in DMFF is 6, which is different from OpenMM**. 

You can also use wildcards when defining torsions. To do this, simply leave the type or class name for an atom empty. That will cause it to match any atom:

```xml
<Proper class1="" class2="OS" class3="P" class4="" periodicity1="3" phase1="0.0" k1="1.046"/>
```

When the tag has an attribute named `mask` and it's value set to `true`, this means the parameter is not trainable. Such information will be passed to `ParamSet.mask` (the corresponding mask value will be 0.0 if not trainable).

# LennardJonesForce

## 1. Theory 

The Lennard-Jones intearction between two particles follows the potential form:

$$ E = 4\epsilon\left(\frac{\sigma^{12}}{r^{12}}-\frac{\sigma^{6}}{r^{6}}\right) $$

where $r$ is the distance between two particles, $\epsilon$ is the depth of the potential wall and $\sigma$ defines the distance where the interaction energy is zero.

The pairwise parameter $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ are determined from the parameters of the individual particles using the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule:

$$\sigma=\frac{\sigma_1+\sigma_2}{2}$$

$$\epsilon = \sqrt{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2} $$

## 2. Frontend

To specify Lennard-Jones interactions, include a tag that looks like this:

```xml
<LennardJonesForce lj14scale="0.5">
  <Atom sigma="0.247679397463798523" epsilon="0.0869048" type="gaff2-hc"/>
  <Atom sigma="0.233928874135017395" epsilon="0.0873315" type="gaff2-h1"/>
  ...
</LennardJonesForce>
```

The `<LennardJones>` tag an attribute `lj14scale` that specify the scale factors between pairs of atoms separated by three bonds. Each `<Atom>` tag specifies the nonbonded parameters for one atom type (specified with the `type` attribute) or atom class (specified with the `class` attribute). `sigma` is in nm, and `epsilon` is in $\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.

<!-- # LennardJonesLongRangeForce

## 1. Theory

When periodic boundary conditions are applied, a energy correction term should be added te approximately evaulate the contribution of all pairs beyond the cutoff distance:

$$ E = -\frac{2\pi N^2}{3V}\cdot\frac{\langle C_6\rangle}{r_c^3} $$

where $N$ is the number of particles in the box, $V$ is the volume of the box, $r_c$ is the cutoff distance, $\langle C_6\rangle$ the avearge six-order interaction coefficient in the LJ potential between all possible pairs, i.e.

$$ \langle C_6\rangle = \frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i\neq j} 4\epsilon_{ij}\sigma_{ij}^6 $$

Note that the excluded pairs (interaction between particles seperated by 1 or 2 bonds) does not count into the summation. -->

# CoulombNoCutoffForce

## 1. Theory

The form of the Coulomb interaction between each pair of particles depends on the `NonbondedMethod` in use. For NoCutoff, it is given by

$$ E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r} $$
 
where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges of the two particles, and $r$ is the distance between them. $\epsilon_0$ is the dielectric constant of vacuum.

## 2. Frontend

To specify Coulomb interactions, include a tag that looks like this:

```xml
<CoulombForce coulomb14scale="0.83333333">
</CoulombForce>
```

The attribute `coulomb14scale` specifies the scale factors between pairs of atoms separated by three bonds.
Notice that the atomic charges are not specified in this tag because different force fields may adopt different approaches to assign atomic charges. **Currently, DMFF supports two approaches to assign atomic charges: template-based and AM1-BCC.**

* In force fields like AMBER, the atomic charges are defined in a template-based manner. Such force fields are usually for protein or nucleic acids that have well-defined building blocks. Hence, the atomic charges can be specified in the `<Residues>` node:

```xml
<Residues>
    <Residue name="ALA">
      <Atom charge="-0.4157" name="N" type="protein-N"/>
      <Atom charge="0.2719" name="H" type="protein-H"/>
      <Atom charge="0.0337" name="CA" type="protein-CX"/>
      <Atom charge="0.0823" name="HA" type="protein-H1"/>
      <Atom charge="-0.1825" name="CB" type="protein-CT"/>
      <Atom charge="0.0603" name="HB1" type="protein-HC"/>
      <Atom charge="0.0603" name="HB2" type="protein-HC"/>
      <Atom charge="0.0603" name="HB3" type="protein-HC"/>
      <Atom charge="0.5973" name="C" type="protein-C"/>
      <Atom charge="-0.5679" name="O" type="protein-O"/>
      <Bond atomName1="N" atomName2="H"/>
      <Bond atomName1="N" atomName2="CA"/>
      <Bond atomName1="CA" atomName2="HA"/>
      <Bond atomName1="CA" atomName2="CB"/>
      <Bond atomName1="CA" atomName2="C"/>
      <Bond atomName1="CB" atomName2="HB1"/>
      <Bond atomName1="CB" atomName2="HB2"/>
      <Bond atomName1="CB" atomName2="HB3"/>
      <Bond atomName1="C" atomName2="O"/>
      <ExternalBond atomName="N"/>
      <ExternalBond atomName="C"/>
    </Residue>
    ...
</Residues>
```

* For arbitrary organic molecules, AM1-BCC approach appears to be an efficient way to derive high-quality charges. The atomic charges are calculated by applying bond charge corrections (BCC) to Mulliken charges under AM1 level of theory. In DMFF, one can define BCC parameters with SMIRKS patterns and call `sqm` to calculate AM1 charges:

```xml
<ForceField>
<Operators>
    <AM1ChargeOperator>
        <SQM path="sqm"/>
    </AM1ChargeOperator>
</Operators>
<CoulombForce coulomb14scale="0.83333333">
    <UseBondChargeCorrection name="MOL"/>
    <BondChargeCorrection bcc="0.0000" smirks="[#6X4:1]-[#6X4:2]"/>
    <BondChargeCorrection bcc="0.0278" smirks="[#6X4:1]-[#6X3:2]"/>
    ...
</CoulombForce>
```



# NonbondedForce

## 1. Theory

The `NonbondedForce` is a summary of `CoulombForce` and `LennardJonesForce` for consistency with OpenMM. With `NonbondedForce`, the force field library of OpenMM can be fluentely used in DMFF. The form of the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb interaction between each pair of particles depends on the `NonbondedMethod` in use. 


## 2. Frontend

To specify NonbondedForce interactions, include a tag that looks like this:

```xml
  <NonbondedForce coulomb14scale="0.8333333333333334" lj14scale="0.5">
    <UseAttributeFromResidue name="charge"/>
    <Atom epsilon="0.359824" sigma="0.3399669508423535" type="protein-C"/>
    <Atom epsilon="0.359824" sigma="0.3399669508423535" type="protein-CA"/>
  </NonbondedForce>
```

The attribute `coulomb14scale` and `lj14scale` specifies the scale factors between pairs of atoms separated by three bonds. The atomic charges are defined in a template-based manner since the `UseAttributeFromResidue` node is added. If node `UseAttributeFromResidue` does not exist, the atomic charges should be specified with `Atom` node, such as:
```xml
  <NonbondedForce coulomb14scale="0.8333333333333334" lj14scale="0.5">
    <Atom epsilon="0.359824" charge="0.131452" sigma="0.3399669508423535" type="protein-C"/>
    <Atom epsilon="0.359824" charge="-0.051223" sigma="0.3399669508423535" type="protein-CA"/>
  </NonbondedForce>
```

# CustomGBJaxForce

## 1. Theory

### Generalized Born Term

The force consists of two energy terms: a Generalized Born Approximation term to represent the electrostatic interaction between the solute and solvent, and a surface area term to represent the free energy cost of solvating a neutral molecule. The Generalized Born energy is given by

$$
E = -\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{solute}}-\frac{1}{\epsilon_{solvent}})\sum_{i,j}\frac{q_iq_j}{f_{GB}(d_{ij},R_i,R_j)}
$$

where the indices $i$ and $j$ run over all particles, $\epsilon_{solute}$ and $\epsilon_{solvent}$ are the dielectric constants of the solute and solvent respectively, $q_i$ is the charge of particle i, and $d_{ij}$ is the distance between particles i and j. And $f_{GB}(d_{ij},R_i,R_j)$ is defined as:

$$
f_{GB}(d_{ij},R_i,R_j)=[d^2_{ij}+R_iR_jexp(-\frac{d^2_{ij}}{4R_iR_j})]^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$

$R_i$ is the Born radius of particle i, which calculated as:

$$
R_i = \frac{1}{\rho_i^{-1}-r_i^{-1}tanh(\alpha\Psi_i-\beta\Psi_i^2+\gamma\Psi_i^3)}
$$

where $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are the $GB^{OBC}II$ parameters $\alpha=1, \beta=0.8,\gamma=4.85$. $\rho_i$ is the adjusted atomic radius of particle i, which is calculated from the atomic radius $r_i$ as $\rho_i=r_i-0.009$ nm. $\Psi_i$ is calculated as an integral over the van der Waals spheres of all particles outside particle i:

$$
\Psi_i=\frac{\rho_i}{4\pi}\int_{VDM}\theta(|r|-\rho_i)\frac{1}{|r|^4}d^3r
$$

where $\theta(r)$ is a step function that excludes the interior of particle i from the integral.

### Surface Area Term

The surface area term is given by:

$$
E=E_{SA}·4\pi\sum_i(r_i+r_{solvent})^2(\frac{r_i}{R_i})^6
$$

where $r_i$ is the atomic radius of particle i, $r_i$ is its atomic radius, and $r_{solvent}$ is the solvent radius, which is taken to be 0.14 nm. The default value for the energy scale $E_{SA}$ is 2.25936 kJ/mol/nm2.

The way to specify a CustomGBJaxForce in DMFF is the same as the way doing it in OpenMM with CustomGBForce:

	</CustomGBForce>

Every `<Atom>` tag defines a rule for creating CustomGBForce interactions between atoms. Each tag may identify the atoms either by type (using the attributes `type1` and `type2`) or by class (using the attributes `class1` and `class2`).



# CustomTorsionJaxForce

## 1. Theory

The torsion is represented by a truncated periodic Fourier series:

$$
E = \sum_{n=0}^{4} k_n(\cos(n\phi-\phi_{0n})) + shift
$$

where $\phi$ is the dihedral angle formed by four particles, $n$ is the periodicity, $\phi_{0n}$ is the phase offset $k_{n}$ is the force constant. To perserve the symmetry, $\phi_{0n}$ usually adopts a value of $0$ (for $n=1,3,5$) or $\pi$ ($n=2,4,6$), and it is recommened to follow these definitions and not to optimize them in force field development.

## 2. Frontend

The way to specify a custom torsion in DMFF is the same as the way doing it in OpenMM:

```xml
<CustomTorsionForce energy="scale*e;e=shift+k1*cos(per1*theta-phase1)+k2*cos(per2*theta-phase2)+k3*cos(per3*theta-phase3)+k4*cos(per4*theta-phase4)">

				k4="0.08531" per4="4" phase4="0.00"/>
	</CustomTorsionForce>
```

Every child tag `<Proper>` or `<improper>` defines a rule for creating periodic torsion interactions between sets of four atoms. Each tag may identify the atoms either by type (using the attributes `type1`, `type2`, ...) or by class (using the attributes `class1`, `class2`, ...).

The force field recognizes two different types of torsions: `Proper` and `Improper`. A proper torsion involves four atoms that are bonded in sequence: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4. An improper torsion involves a central atom and three others that are bonded to it: atoms 2, 3, and 4 are all bonded to atom 1.  `per1` is the periodicity of the torsion, `phase1` is the phase offset in radians, and `k1` is the force constant in kJ/mol. To add a second periodicity, just add three more attributes: `per2`, `phase2`, and `k2`. **The maxium periodicity supported in DMFF is 6, which is different from OpenMM**.

You can also use wildcards when defining torsions. To do this, simply leave the type or class name for an atom empty. That will cause it to match any atom:

```xml
<Proper class1="" class2="Pb" class3="Pb" class4="Pb" per1="3" phase1="0.0" k1="1.046" shift="4.231"/>
```

When the tag has an attribute named `mask` and it's value set to `true`, this means the parameter is not trainable. Such information will be passed to `ParamSet.mask` (the corresponding mask value will be 0.0 if not trainable).


# Custom1_5BondJaxForce

## 1. Theory

The force is used to regulate the atoms relation between atom 1 to 5 in coarse-grained polyphosphate.

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}k(b-b_0)^2
$$

where $k$ is the force constant, $b$ is the distance betweeen two particles that forming a bond and $b_0$ is the equilibrium bond length. Note that in some other MD softwares, the potential form adopts a slight different form: $E=k(b-b_0)^2$. Users should check which form to use and multiply (or divide) the force constant by 2.

## 2. Frontend

The way to specify a harmonic bond in DMFF is different from the way doing it in OpenMM, which requires add special force `openmm.CustomCompoundBondForce()` in coding:

```xml
<Custom1_5BondForce energy="0.5*k*(r-length)^2">
    <Bond atomIndex1="0" atomIndex2="4" k="3550.00" length="0.9463225"/>
    <Bond atomIndex1="1" atomIndex2="5" k="3550.00" length="0.9463225"/>
    <Bond atomIndex1="2" atomIndex2="6" k="3550.00" length="0.9463225"/>
    <Bond atomIndex1="3" atomIndex2="7" k="3550.00" length="0.9463225"/>
    <Bond atomIndex1="4" atomIndex2="8" k="3550.00" length="0.9463225"/>
    <Bond atomIndex1="5" atomIndex2="9" k="3550.00" length="0.9463225"/>
</Custom1_5BondForce>
```
When using this force, you need to add `openmm.CustomCompoundBondForce()` during your simulation:

```python
h = Hamiltonian("CG.xml")
params = h.getParameters()
compoundBondForceParam = params["Custom1_5BondForce"]
length = compoundBondForceParam["length"]
k = compoundBondForceParam["k"]
system = ff.createSystem(pdb.topology, nonbondedMethod=NoCutoff)
customCompoundForce = openmm.CustomCompoundBondForce(2, "0.5*k*(distance(p1,p2)-length)^2")
customCompoundForce.addPerBondParameter("length")
customCompoundForce.addPerBondParameter("k")
for i, leng in enumerate(length):
    customCompoundForce.addBond([i, i+4], [leng, k[i]])
system.addForce(customCompoundForce)
```

Every `<Bond>` tag defines a rule for creating harmonic bond interactions between 1 and 5 atoms. Each tag may identify the atoms by index (using the attributes `atomIndex1` and `atomIndex2`). `length` is the equilibrium bond length in $\mathrm{nm}$, and `k` is the force constant in $\mathrm{kJ/mol/nm^2}$.
